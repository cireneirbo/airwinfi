# airwinfi

A site that shows you where you can get free internet or internet paired with the cheapest menu item at the business.


What the project does

Airwinfi utilizes Google Maps API to show the user local wifi connections at nearby libraries and low-cost cafes and restaurants. It also suggests the lowest cost item on the menu at restaurants to the user. This feature is added to inform the user of the best option for achieving the establishment's wifi password and avoiding 'dirty looks' from the staff.

A feature we'd like to incorporate is a user login system that allows users to update locations on the map to share their own internet hotspots and wifi. For now, the yellow placeholder pin simulates this.

Why the project is useful

Airwinfi encourages connectivity and promotes easy to find access points to the internet. The user base targeted is lower-income people who may not have access to the internet regularly. The design of Airwinfi is simple, and is geared towards a user who may have limited data on their mobile phone.
